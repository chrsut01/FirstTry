Christopher S Sutherland

Hi! My name is Chris. I am an American living in Tønder, Denmark.
Jeg har boet her juli 2016.

Some things I'm interested in:
Music - I play the violin and viola, although I don't have much time for it lately.
Cooking - I like to cook, especially Asian food and Asian inspired food.

I currently work and Hydro Extrusion Tønder. I used to also work at
Tønder Kulturskole but had to stop in order to start the Datamatikker program at EASV.
